# Functional Spring Boot
Slides for Functional Spring Boot talk presented at Devnexus in 2025

10 years after the advent of Spring, Spring Boot shifted the paradigm from XML to Annotations. 10 years later, it is time to shift the paradigm again, this time toward functional programming. Spring Boot has been quietly adding functional APIs and DSLs since 2.0. These APIs deliver many benefits such as better performance and easier learning curve. In this talk, we will learn how to uncover these hidden gems in Spring Boot.
